    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>I’m a final-year B.Tech student deeply passionate about technology, creativity, and solving real-world problems. Over time, I’ve developed a strong foundation in full-stack development and artificial intelligence, working on projects that combine user emotion, environmental data, and AI logic — like Melodify, an Indian classical music recommendation system that detects mood and weather to suggest songs using DeepFace and weather APIs.</p>

    <p>My interests span across LLMs, computer vision, and interactive web applications. I’ve built tools like Prompt2Play, which generates and narrates children’s stories with AI, and AI Dataset Analyzer, which creates visual data insights with GPT-powered narratives. I enjoy exploring frameworks such as Flask, Gradio, LangChain, and tools like SQLite, Hugging Face models, and OpenAI APIs to bring ideas to life. I also have hands-on experience with model fine-tuning using QLoRA for chatbot development in mental health support.</p>

    <p>Beyond tech, I’m a music enthusiast who loves composing and experimenting with audio production tools. I enjoy organizing and planning — often setting reminders and breaking down tasks into to-do lists. I’m always looking for new challenges that allow me to merge my creative side with my technical skills, aiming to build useful, user-focused systems that leave a meaningful impact.</p>
